Hydra project -Alpha version 
########################################################

This project runs a script that can accept multiple search terms. 
A spreadsheet with a list of those terms and their resulting genes
and the transcripts of those genes is produced. 

Notes: 
This program requires py2exe to be installed on your Windows machine. 
Type in your command line window the following to install it: 

pip install py2exe  

(Temp note, the package of files is not setup to be installed by py2exe just yet.
My upgraded virtual box is having some issues so it may take a bit before I can 
use py2exe to make a package for general use. 
For now run the following in your window: 

python hydra_trans_fetch.py


The spreadsheet is placed in the Hydra folder.
